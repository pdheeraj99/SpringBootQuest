**Spring Boot Actuators**
==========================

### Introduction

Spring Boot Actuators are a set of production-ready features that provide insights into an application's performance, health, and other metrics.

### Key Features

* **Health Checks**: Monitor the application's health and detect any issues
* **Info**: Display information about the application, such as the build version and Git commit hash
* **Metrics**: Expose metrics about the application's performance, such as CPU usage and memory usage
* **Beans**: List all the Spring beans in the application context
* **Autoconfig**: Display the auto-configuration report
* **Env**: Expose the application's environment properties
* **Mappings**: Display the request mappings of the application's controllers
* **Shutdown**: Allow the application to be shut down remotely

### Endpoints

Actuators are exposed as HTTP endpoints, which can be accessed using a web browser or a tool like curl. By default, they are available under the `/actuator` path.

* `/actuator/health`
* `/actuator/info`
* `/actuator/metrics`

### Security

Actuators can be secured using Spring Security. You can configure which endpoints are exposed and who can access them.

```properties
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,metrics
```

### Configuration

Actuators can be configured using properties in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

```properties
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,metrics
```

### Example Configuration

To enable the `health`, `info`, and `metrics` actuators and expose them as HTTP endpoints, you can add the following configuration to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,metrics
```

### Benefits

Using Spring Boot Actuators provides several benefits, including:

* Improved monitoring and management of applications
* Enhanced security and access control
* Simplified troubleshooting and debugging
* Better insights into application performance and health

### Common Use Cases

Actuators are commonly used in production environments to monitor and manage applications. They are also useful during development and testing to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

### Best Practices

Some best practices for using Actuators include:

* Securing Actuator endpoints using Spring Security
* Configuring Actuators to expose only the necessary information
* Using Actuators in conjunction with other monitoring and management tools

### Code Examples

#### Enabling Actuators

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

#### Configuring Actuators

```properties
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,metrics
```

#### Securing Actuators

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/actuator/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .and()
            .formLogin();
    }
}
```

#### Creating a Custom Actuator

```java
@Component
@Endpoint(id = "myactuator")
public class MyActuator {
    @ReadOperation
    public String myOperation() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```
